An Online Ticket Management System is a project where users can book, cancel, and manage tickets for various services such as movie shows, travel, or events. In a Database Management System (DBMS), this involves creating a structured database to store and manage ticket-related data, including user details, ticket information, schedules, and transaction history.

Here's a basic outline for a DBMS project on Online Ticket Management System:

1. Project Overview
The system allows users to:

Book tickets for various events or services.
View available options based on schedules and availability.
Cancel or modify bookings.
Make payments and receive receipts.
2. System Features
User Registration/Login: A user must register or log in to book tickets.
Event/Service Listings: Users can browse available shows, travel services, or events.
Seat/Slot Availability: Display the availability of seats or slots in real-time.
Ticket Booking: Users can select services, pick dates, and confirm bookings.
Cancellation & Refund: Users can cancel bookings and view refund policies.
Payment Gateway: Integrate a payment system to complete the booking process.
3. Database Design
The following tables can be used to manage the data:

Users:

UserID (Primary Key)
Name
Email
Password
Phone
Services (Movies/Travel/Events):

ServiceID (Primary Key)
ServiceType (Movie, Train, Bus, etc.)
Name (e.g., Movie Name, Train Number)
Date

Payments:

PaymentID (Primary Key)
TicketID (Foreign Key)
Amount
PaymentDate
PaymentMode (Credit/Debit/UPI)
Admin:

AdminID (Primary Key)

Password
4. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD will define relationships between entities (tables):

Users can book multiple Tickets.
Each Ticket is linked to a specific Service.
Payments are associated with Tickets.
Admin manages the Services and oversees bookings.

5. User Interface (Optional)
If you're also working on a front-end:

Login/Register pages for users and admin.
A dashboard to display available services.
Booking page to select services and seats.
Payment page for completing transactions.

6. Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional)
Backend: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
DBMS: MySQL, Oracle, etc.
